Often times you can provide a template and chatGPT will follow it. Example:

You are an expert course designer and extensive experience developing college courses. We will co-design a course on using python to analyze data, assuming that students are total beginners to programming and using python. Provide an outline of the course syllabus using the following template:

---

# Course title
$course_title

# Course abstract
$course_abstract

# Learning objectives
$learning_objectives

# Grading
$grading

# Schedule of topics
#schedule_of_topics
---
This will generate a syllabus with each item in the $ section completed by chatGPT.
