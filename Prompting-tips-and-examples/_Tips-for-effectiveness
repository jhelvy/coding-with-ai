## Three approaches for prompting:
1. Envision ChatGPT as your partner.
2. Imagine you are speaking with a colleague.
3. Give thought to providing detailed prommpts.

## Formatting tips:
1. Use bullet points to list specific items or ideas.
		– This will help the AI to know a sequence to follow.
2. Use markdown for inline formatting. (ChatGPT writes in MD.)
    – Use bold for emphasis.
			i. **text**
		– Use italics for emphasis or to indicate titles.
			i. *text*
		– Use strikethrough to indicate something that should not be included.
			i. ~text~
		– Use > to indicate blockquotes.
			i. >text
3. Use code blocks to indicate specific language or code.
		– Example: "Write a tutorial on how to set up a basic website using HTML and CSS. Include <html>, <head>, and <body>tags in the code examples."
``` { code } ```

## General guidelines:
1. Tell ChatGPT the role you want it to fill.
2. Clearly state the topic.
3. Provide context and background information.
    – I am looking to understand how much time people spend on an average weekday commuting from home to work.
4. Avoid ambiguity and overly descriptive language.
    – Give me a list of 10 US cities with the most beautiful commute.
5. Use direct language.
    – Give me a list of 10 US cities with average commute times of more than 60 minutes.
6. Chunk the prompt into conversive sentences rather than directions.
    – Recall the story 'Moby Dick'. List each character and write a 5-7 sentence character analysis of each one. Include information that captures their appearance and personality.
