## Deeper – A partner to explore ideas
**Question refinement**
Prompt-1: 
I need some help digging deeper into a topic. Whenever I ask you a question, I need you to suggest to me a better version of the question to think about instead.

Prompt-2: 
What are the benefits of using ChatGPT to assist me with learning to be a more proficient programmer?

ChatGPT: 
A more nuanced question to consider could be: "How can ChatGPT specifically enhance various aspects of my programming skills, from understanding algorithms to debugging, and what are its limitations in the context of programming education?"

Prompt-3: 
Please do the same with this question. What are some different techniques to handle missing data in a machine learning project?

ChatGPT: 
A more refined question to explore might be: "What are the pros and cons of various techniques for handling missing data in machine learning projects, and how do these methods impact model performance and interpretability?"

**Outline expansion**
Prompt-1: 
I'd like you to act as an outline expander. Please generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me which bullet point you should expand on. Each bullet point can have at most 3 sub bullets. For the bullet point I select, create a new outline. After each outline, ask me which bullet you should expand next.

Prompt-2: 
Writing effective ChatGPT prompts for improved programming.

ChatGPT:
Here's the outline based on your input:

1. Introduction
   - Importance of effective prompts
   - Objectives of the guide
   - Who should read this guide
  
2. Understanding ChatGPT
   - How it works
   - Limitations
   - Use-cases in programming

3. Components of an Effective Prompt
   - Clarity
   - Specificity
   - Contextual information

4. Techniques for Writing Prompts
   - The "Ask-Tell" method
   - Iterative refinement
   - Leveraging token count

5. Examples and Case Studies
   - Good vs Bad prompts
   - Real-world applications
   - Pitfalls to avoid

6. Testing and Validation
   - Methods for testing
   - Common pitfalls
   - Feedback loops

7. Conclusion
   - Summary of key points
   - Next steps for implementation
   - Additional resources

Which bullet point would you like to see expanded next?
